## Progress

*Note: may show an outdated state of development.*

## TODO

### Game

- Introduce a UI library (title screen, inventory, etc.).
- Introduce more player interaction mechanics.
- Introduce new cereals, vegetables, etc.

### Implementation

- Introduce scaling and full screen.
- Safer game and server implementation (and more correct error handling).

## Project

- `game` - the game assets and code
- `packet` - a packet manipulation library and protocol constants
- `server` - the protocol implementation
- `try` - a tiny helper function to avoid verbose error handling

## Building

Using the Go build system is highly encouraged. Not before cloning the repository!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dacousb/feiok
cd feiok
go build
```

## Running

Run the generated binary by the *building* step, or use the built-in Go command.

```sh
go run . -help
```
